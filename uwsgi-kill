# uwsgi-kill (part of ossobv/vcutil) // wdoekes/2014 // Public Domain
#
# Sends the TERM signal to the parent uwsgi(-core) process to make it
# restart all children. Instead of doing /etc/init.d/uwsgi restart, this
# is quicker (less downtime).
#
# As an added bonus, you can select which parent you want to kill by
# adding arguments.
#
# Usage:
#
#    uwsgi-kill
#    # kills all uwsgi parents
#
#    uwsgi-kill somesite
#    # kills the uwsgi parent that matches "somesite"
#
